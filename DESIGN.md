We chose to use a flask application because we knew we wanted to have a more dynamic webpage that allowed for ideas like randomization of the QuackLib template when the user pressed a button. We also knew we would want to use jinja to modify the stories based on user input. 

Our app.py code is fairly simple and mostly serves to redirect the user to various pages. It's primary role is to take user input from the forms and pass that input to the "done" version of that html page. 




This is a document where we talk about why we designed the code the way we did. It should be several paragraphs in length.
