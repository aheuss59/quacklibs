<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<p>
    Hoping to transcend the <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u> of quotidian duck life, larger than <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u> CS 50 mascot, DDB resolutely elected 
    to embark upon a sojourn into <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u> for a duck boat tour on the <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u> Watercourse. After all, perchance DDB 
    might happen upon some distant kin! Armed with all the <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u> accouterments such as <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u> and <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> 
    DDB and his friend could need, they commenced upon the grand expedition. They <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> to the aquatic vessel just in time for the 
    disembarking. On the meticulously guided duck boat tour, they were afforded the opportunity to imbibe an abundance of diverse 
    sights, such as the venerable <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u> edifices, monumental <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u> architectural marvels, and even the renowned 
    <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u> locales. They also espied a myriad of indigenous fauna, including the double-billed <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u>. DDB and 
    <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u> were enraptured, for they even gleaned a fleeting glimpse of the rare <u>{{ inputs[13] }}</u> species! Whilst DDB 
    encountered a duo of distant relatives amidst the aqueous expanse, indubitably the <u>{{ inputs[14] }}</u> part of the entire tour 
    transpired when they were bestowed with a duck whistle at the denouement that emitted a resonant <u>{{ inputs[15] }}</u> quack. What an 
    <u>{{ inputs[16] }}</u> diurnal event!
