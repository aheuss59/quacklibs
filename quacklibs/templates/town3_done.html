<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<p>
    Hoping to escape the <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u> of daily duck life, larger than  <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u> CS 50 mascot DDB decided to venture into 
    <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u> for a duck boat tour on the <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u> River. After all, maybe DDB would run into some distant relatives! 
    Equipped with all the <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u>, <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u>, and <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> they could need, DDB and her friend headed off to the 
    tour. They <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> to the boat just in time for cast off. On the guided duck boat tour, they were able to take in many 
    different sights, such as the historic <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u>, monumental <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u>, and even the infamous <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u>. They 
    were also able to see lots of native wildlife, including the double-billed <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u>. DDB and <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u> were thrilled 
    because they even caught a glimpse of the rare <u>{{ inputs[13] }}</u> bird! While DDB ran into a couple of distant relatives on the water, 
    undoubtedly the most <u>{{ inputs[14] }}</u> part of the entire tour was getting a duck whistle at the end that made a great big 
    <u>{{ inputs[15] }}</u> sound. What a great <u>{{ inputs[16] }}</u> day!
