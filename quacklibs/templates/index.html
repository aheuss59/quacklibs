Welcome to QuackLibs! Select a level to begin!

<!-- Very simple Homepage to start, just links to the pages for different levels of the Mad Libs-->
<!-- In the final product, I'm thinking the homepage could maybe look sort of like the homepage for Canvas, --> 
<!-- with an image relating to the level and a brief description-->

<a href="/level1">Level 1</a>
<a href="/level2">Level 2</a>
<a href="/level3">Level 3</a>

<!-- TODO: implement a pretty user interface to select levels -->
