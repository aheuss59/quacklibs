<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<p>
    Hoping to emancipate oneself from the {{ inputs[0] }} of everyday duck life, larger than {{ inputs[1] }} CS 50 mascot DDB resolved 
    to explore {{ inputs[2] }} for a duck boat tour on the {{ inputs[3] }} Waterway. After all, perhaps DDB would encounter some distant 
    relatives! Outfitted with all the provisions required such as {{ inputs[4] }} and {{ inputs[5] }}, DDB and her friend embarked on 
    the tour. They {{ inputs[6] }} to the boat just in time for departure. On the guided duck boat tour, they were able to appreciate 
    an array of sights, such as the historic {{ inputs[7] }} landmarks, monumental {{ inputs[8] }} marvels, and even the infamous 
    {{ inputs[9] }} locations. They also observed a plethora of indigenous fauna, including the double-billed {{ inputs[10] }}. DDB 
    and {{ inputs[11] }} were elated as they even caught a glimpse of the rare {{ inputs[12] }}! While DDB encountered a few distant 
    relatives on the water, unquestionably the {{ inputs[13] }} part of the entire tour was acquiring a duck whistle at the conclusion 
    that emitted a resounding {{ inputs[14] }} quack. What a {{ inputs[15] }} day!
