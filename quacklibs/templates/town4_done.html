<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<p>
    Hoping to emancipate oneself from the <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u> of everyday duck life, larger than <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u> CS 50 mascot DDB resolved 
    to explore <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u> for a duck boat tour on the <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u> Waterway. After all, perhaps DDB would encounter some distant 
    relatives! Outfitted with all the provisions required such as <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u> and <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u>, DDB and her friend embarked on 
    the tour. They <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> to the boat just in time for departure. On the guided duck boat tour, they were able to appreciate 
    an array of sights, such as the historic <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> landmarks, monumental <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u> marvels, and even the infamous 
    <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u> locations. They also observed a plethora of indigenous fauna, including the double-billed <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u>. DDB 
    and <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u> were elated as they even caught a glimpse of the rare <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u>! While DDB encountered a few distant 
    relatives on the water, unquestionably the <u>{{ inputs[13] }}</u> part of the entire tour was acquiring a duck whistle at the conclusion 
    that emitted a resounding <u>{{ inputs[14] }}</u> quack. What a <u>{{ inputs[15] }}</u> day!
