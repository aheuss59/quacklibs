<h4>Duck Goes to Disney!</h4>
<p>
    While helping teach CS 50 alongside Professor {{ inputs[0] }} on Harvard's campus, DDB began to feel a bit {{ inputs[1] }}. After 
    all, DDB hadn't seen any of her relatives since flying the {{ inputs[2] }} journey to campus after {{ inputs[3] }}. On the widely 
    used social media site {{ inputs[4] }}, DDB saw that her cousins {{ inputs[5] }} and {{ inputs[6] }} had {{ inputs[7] }} 
    jobs at Disney World! So, DDB wanted to see her cousins, and also try out the {{ inputs[8] }} ride at Magic Kingdom called the 
    {{ inputs[9] }}. Upon {{ inputs[10] }} at Disney World, DDB couldn't figure out where to begin! After all, there were amazing shows 
    like "The {{ inputs[11] }} Acrobats of {{ inputs[12] }}" and different attractions like "It's a {{ inputs[13] }} World." However, 
    DDB wanted to see her cousins before anything else. DDB asked one of the many {{ inputs[14] }} around Disney World where to find 
    her cousins at. They directed DDB towards the Mickey Mouse {{ inputs[15] }} house. Alongside Mickey and Minnie Mouse, as well as 
    Goofy and Pluto, DDB found her cousins with their stage names {{ inputs[16] }} Duck and {{ inputs[17] }} Duck. This made DDB wonder 
    if she should create her own personal stage name for class, something like "The {{ inputs[18] }} Duck!" Or, maybe that would be 
    too {{ inputs[19] }} for CS 50. DDB had such a(n) {{ inputs[20] }} time with her cousins! It was {{ inputs[21] }} to see them after 
    so many {{ inputs[22] }}. After a long day, DDB said {{ inputs[23] }} to her cousins and went back to campus feeling 
    {{ inputs[24] }} and a lot less homesick!
