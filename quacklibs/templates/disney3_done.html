<h4>Duck Goes to Disney!</h4>
<p>
    While helping teach CS 50 alongside Professor <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u> on Harvard's campus, DDB began to feel a bit <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u>. After 
    all, DDB hadn't seen any of her relatives since flying the <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u> journey to campus after <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u>. On the widely 
    used social media site <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u>, DDB saw that her cousins <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u> and <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> had <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> 
    jobs at Disney World! So, DDB wanted to see her cousins, and also try out the <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u> ride at Magic Kingdom called the 
    <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u>. Upon <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u> at Disney World, DDB couldn't figure out where to begin! After all, there were amazing shows 
    like "The <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u> Acrobats of <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u>" and different attractions like "It's a <u>{{ inputs[13] }}</u> World." However, 
    DDB wanted to see her cousins before anything else. DDB asked one of the many <u>{{ inputs[14] }}</u> around Disney World where to find 
    her cousins at. They directed DDB towards the Mickey Mouse <u>{{ inputs[15] }}</u> house. Alongside Mickey and Minnie Mouse, as well as 
    Goofy and Pluto, DDB found her cousins with their stage names <u>{{ inputs[16] }}</u> Duck and <u>{{ inputs[17] }}</u> Duck. This made DDB wonder 
    if she should create her own personal stage name for class, something like "The <u>{{ inputs[18] }}</u> Duck!" Or, maybe that would be 
    too <u>{{ inputs[19] }}</u> for CS 50. DDB had such a(n) <u>{{ inputs[20] }}</u> time with her cousins! It was <u>{{ inputs[21] }}</u> to see them after 
    so many <u>{{ inputs[22] }}</u>. After a long day, DDB said <u>{{ inputs[23] }}</u> to her cousins and went back to campus feeling 
    <u>{{ inputs[24] }}</u> and a lot less homesick!
