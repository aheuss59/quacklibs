<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<!-- This code does not work right now - need to clarify which lib we are using here -->
<p>
    Hoping to get away from the {{ inputs[0] }} of everyday duck life, bigger than a  {{ inputs[1] }} CS 50 mascot DDB decided to 
    explore {{ inputs[2] }} for a duck boat tour on the {{ inputs[3] }} river. With {{ inputs[4] }} and {{ inputs[5] }} in tow, they 
    {{ inputs[6] }} to the boat just in time for departure. On the tour, they saw {{ inputs[7] }}, {{ inputs[8] }}, and even 
    {{ inputs[9] }}. They also saw {{ inputs[10] }} ducks. DDB and {{ inputs[11] }} were excited as they even caught a glimpse of 
    a {{ inputs[12] }} bird! The {{ inputs[13] }} part was getting a duck whistle at the end that made a big {{ inputs[14] }} sound. 
    What an awesome day!
