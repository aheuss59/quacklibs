<h4>Duck Goes to Disney!</h4>
<p>
    DDB helped at school with {{ inputs[0] }}. She felt {{ inputs[1] }} because she missed her family. On a fun site called
    {{ inputs[2] }}, DDB saw that her cousins {{ inputs[3] }} and {{ inputs[4] }} worked at Disney World! DDB wanted to see them and 
    try the ride {{ inputs[5] }} at the Magic Kingdom. When she got there, she didn't know where to start! There were shows like 
    "The Dazzling Acrobats" and "It's a {{ inputs[6] }} World." But first, she wanted to see her cousins. DDB asked a {{ inputs[7] }} 
    where to find them. They said to look at the Mickey Mouse {{ inputs[8] }}. There, she found her cousins with stage names 
    {{ inputs[9] }} and {{ inputs[10] }}. DDB thought about a fun stage name for school, like "The {{ inputs[11] }} Duck!" She had a 
    great time! After a long day, DDB said goodbye and felt {{ inputs[12] }}.
