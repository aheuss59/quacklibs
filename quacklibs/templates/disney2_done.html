<h4>Duck Goes to Disney!</h4>
<p>
    DDB helped at school with <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u>. She felt <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u> because she missed her family. On a fun site called
    <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u>, DDB saw that her cousins <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u> and <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u> worked at Disney World! DDB wanted to see them and 
    try the ride <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u> at the Magic Kingdom. When she got there, she didn't know where to start! There were shows like 
    "The Dazzling Acrobats" and "It's a <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> World." But first, she wanted to see her cousins. DDB asked a <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> 
    where to find them. They said to look at the Mickey Mouse <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u>. There, she found her cousins with stage names 
    <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u> and <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u>. DDB thought about a fun stage name for school, like "The <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u> Duck!" She had a 
    great time! After a long day, DDB said goodbye and felt <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u>.
