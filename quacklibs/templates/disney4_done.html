<h4>Duck Goes to Disney!</h4>
<p>
    In the midst of teaching CS 50 at Harvard alongside the esteemed Professor <u>{{ inputs[0] }}</u>, DDB found herself grappling with a 
    touch of <u>{{ inputs[1] }}</u>. The last time she'd seen family was on the extensive <u>{{ inputs[2] }}</u> back to campus post-summer break. 
    On the ever-popular social media hub <u>{{ inputs[3] }}</u>, she stumbled upon the <u>{{ inputs[4] }}</u> news that her cousins <u>{{ inputs[5] }}</u> 
    and <u>{{ inputs[6] }}</u> had landed gigs at Disney World! This discovery ignited a dual desire within DDB, to reconnect with family and 
    to dive into the <u>{{ inputs[7] }}</u> of the renowned Magic Kingdom ride, the <u>{{ inputs[8] }}</u>.
</p>
<p>
    Once at Disney World, the sheer array of options, from <u>{{ inputs[9] }}</u> acrobatic shows to the <u>{{ inputs[10] }}</u> wonders of 
    "It's a <u>{{ inputs[11] }}</u> World," left DDB feeling a bit <u>{{ inputs[12] }}</u>. However, her priority was tracking down her cousins. 
    A <u>{{ inputs[13] }}</u> guide pointed her toward the Mickey Mouse <u>{{ inputs[14] }}</u> house, where she happily reunited with her cousins, 
    now going by the playful names <u>{{ inputs[15] }}</u> Duck and <u>{{ inputs[16] }}</u> Duck.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by their <u>{{ inputs[17] }}</u> flair, DDB toyed with the idea of adopting a unique moniker for herself in the academic setting, 
    perhaps something like "The <u>{{ inputs[18] }}</u> Tech Duck!" Yet, the thought of injecting too much whimsy into the <u>{{ inputs[19] }}</u> 
    atmosphere of CS 50 gave her pause. Nevertheless, the day turned out to be a fantastic blend of <u>{{ inputs[20] }}</u> and family time, 
    easing the homesickness that had lingered.
</p>
<p>
    As the day wound down, DDB bid farewell to her cousins, carrying a mix of emotions, a sense of <u>{{ inputs[21] }}</u> from the day's 
    escapades and a <u>{{ inputs[22] }}</u> reduction in <u>{{ inputs[23] }}</u>. Returning to campus, she reflected on the <u>{{ inputs[24] }}</u> power of 
    family connections and the <u>{{ inputs[25] }}</u> derived from venturing beyond the academic confines.
