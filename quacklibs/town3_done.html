<h4>Duck Takes a Tour!</h4>
<p>
    Hoping to escape the {{ inputs[0] }} of daily duck life, larger than a {{ inputs[1] }} CS 50 mascot DDB decided to 
    venture into {{ inputs[2] }} for a duck boat tour on the {{ inputs[3] }} river. After all, maybe DDB would run into some 
    distant relatives! Equipped with all the {{ inputs[4] }}, {{ inputs[5] }}, and {{ inputs[6] }} DDB could need, {{ inputs[7] }} 
    and DDB's friend {{ inputs[8] }} headed off to the tour. They {{ inputs[9] }} to the boat just in time for cast off. On the guided 
    duck boat tour, they were able to take in many different sights, such as the historic {{ inputs[10] }}, monumental {{ inputs[11] }}, 
    and even the infamous {{ inputs[12] }}. They also were able to see lots of native wildlife, including the double-billed 
    {{ inputs[13] }}. DDB and {{ inputs[14] }} were thrilled because they even caught a glimpse of the rare {{ inputs[15] }}! While 
    DDB ran into a couple of distant relatives on the water, undoubtedly the {{ inputs[16] }} part of the entire tour was getting 
    a duck whistle at the end that made a great big {{ inputs[17] }} sound. What a great day!
