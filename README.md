Sources/help: In this project, we received extensive help from the CS50 duck and, in repayment, we have dedicated the entire lore of the website to DDB, whom all of the QuackLibs are about. We also used ChatGPT for help with debugging. Talia wrote our amazing QuackLibs and used ChatGPT to help modify them to fit each reading level. In order to test the readability level of each storyline to ensure that it was in line with our readability level ranges, we used this website: https://readabilityformulas.com/readability-scoring-system.php with the applied filter of the Coleman-Liau Index. Individual image sources are cited at the bottom of the pages they are located on. The source for the logo in the navigation bar is cited on the homepage. Bootstrap's online documentation was referenced frequently. 

This program was created in a WSL: Ubuntu space on VS Code and requires Python, JavaScript, CSS, jinja, and html. To compile the program, first make sure you have python-dotenv installed. If you do not, you should be able to install using "pip install python-dotenv". From there, make sure you are in the folder quacklibs within the quacklibs project (the terminal should say quacklibs/quacklibs$). You should then be able to run the application using "flask run" in the terminal. You should then be able to use the link in the terminal to take youself to the homepage of our website where you should be greeted by some cute ducks.

Our final project is an online version of the classic game, MadLibs, for which we have put a CS50 spin on. We chose to design an interactive website entitled QuackLibs that features personally-designed MadLibs with CS 50's beloved DDB as the main character in all the storylines. Our website allows a user to choose which reading level they are at, with 5 different reading levels spanning 2nd grade and below, 3rd grade to 5th grade, 6th grade to 8th grade, 9th grade to 11th grade, and 12th grade and above.  

The user has the option of either selecting the "Go to Page" button that is shown on the card associated with the desired reading level the user wishes to play at or instead look under the navigation bar shown at the top of the page and click the button associated with their desired reading level. This redirects the user to a page that confirms the reading level they have selected to play at, and allows the user to press "Start a QuackLib Now!" in order to begin a randomly generated MadLib at the selected reading level. The code associated with these redirect pages is shown in the .html files with the name "level#.html" (with the # ranging from 1-5 based on level with 1 as grade 2 and below) that are listed under the "templates" folder. 

The user will then have the chance to fill out a form to provide input that will be plugged into the stories later on. All input fields are required and some will auto-capitalize to make sense in the context of the story. It is in your best interest to fill out the form with the requested word (if it asks for a noun, you should actually provide a noun). We will not stop you from inputting a verb in place of a noun, but the story will not make as much sense and will not be as fun when you are done. When you are finished filling in your words, click the submit button at the bottom of the page to receive your completed QuackLib. You may complete another by using the navigation bar to return to your reading level and randomly generating a new QuackLib.
